**FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT**

**WMS System for Wholesale Distribution with QuickBooks Desktop Integration**

**FINAL VERSION**

**Revised Complete Functional Design and Interface Overview**

**I. Functional Design Principles**

1.  **Domain-Centric Application Structure:** Sales, Delivery, Warehouse, Management, Admin.  Organize application features and interfaces into these core business domains for clarity and user focus.
2.  **Flexible User Access Model:** User-Level Staff flexible access to User Domains (Sales, Delivery, Warehouse); Manager to Management & User Domains; Admin to Admin, Management & User Domains.  Provide broad access for operational staff to user-level domains while restricting management and admin functions to appropriate roles.
3.  **Shared Route Concept:** Routes as location-based itineraries for Sales and Delivery. Utilize a shared 'Route' entity to manage sequences of stops for both sales representatives and delivery drivers, ensuring route consistency.
4.  **Tablet-Optimized User Interfaces (User Domains):** Tablet-first design for Sales, Delivery, and Warehouse domains, ensuring usability on mobile devices for field and warehouse staff.
5.  **Desktop-Optimized Management and Admin Panels (Management & Admin Domains):** Desktop-focused design for Management and Admin domains, optimized for data-rich views and administrative tasks best suited for larger screens.
6.  **Consistent Bootstrap 5 & HTMX UI Framework:** Implement a consistent user interface across all domains using Bootstrap 5 for responsive design and styling, and HTMX to enhance interactivity with minimal JavaScript, focusing on server-side rendering and dynamic updates.
7.  **QuickBooks Desktop Centric Design:** Design the application as an extension of QuickBooks Desktop, primarily leveraging QuickBooks data models and minimizing the creation of redundant custom data models. The system will synchronize seamlessly with QuickBooks Desktop to ensure data consistency and act as an operational front-end for QuickBooks data.
8.  **Automated Data Workflows:** Implement automated data flows to streamline business processes. Data should automatically progress through workflows (e.g., Sales Order -> Picking -> Loading -> Delivery) without manual intervention at each step, triggered by user actions within the system.

**II. User Roles and Responsibilities**

1.  **Admin (System Administrator):** Responsible for system configuration, QuickBooks integration management, user account management (system-level), data import/export, and overall technical maintenance of the WMS system.  Access to Admin and Management Domains.
2.  **Manager (Operations Manager, Route Planner, Warehouse Manager, etc.):** Responsible for business operations management, including route planning, driver and sales rep management, inventory oversight, procurement, and reporting. Access to Management and User Domains.
3.  **User (Staff User - Sales Rep, Delivery Driver, Warehouse Staff):** Responsible for executing daily operational tasks within their respective domains (Sales, Delivery, Warehouse). Flexible access to all User Domains to support various operational needs. Access to User Domains only.
